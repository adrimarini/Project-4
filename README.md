### Summary:
<i> Traveling abroad? Looking for a place to stay? This app is a way to find a safe pad to crash at when in a foreign place- and maybe even a way to make a new freind! With the option to open your home to other women traveling, or the option to search for a host, this app makes adventuring cheap and memorable! </i>

*<strong>WARNING:</strong> Yes, its true, the app is exclusive to <strong><i> women </strong></i> ! Sorry boys nothing personal, but this time it all comes down to safety.

### Concept:
The idea of this app is a play off couch-surfing. When a user enters the site, they will decide if they want to be a 'Host' or 'Looking to be hosted'. If they choose the 'Host' option, then the user would be looking to open their home to a traveler looking for a place to stay. As a Host, they have the power to specify how long they want to open their doors to the world for.
<br>
If a user chose the 'Looking to be hosted' option, they are most likely a traveler looking for a place to crash for a short amount of time.

### Interaction:
####<i>Looking to be Hosted</i>
If the user is looking to be hosted, they will be directed to a map view, where they will be prompted to input their destination location. Once specified, pins will appear around that location of host homes in the area. The user can pick a location they would be interested in staying, and see the information about the Host. They can contact the Host via Mailer in order to make arrangements about their stay.

####<i>Hosts</i>
If a user has chosen to be a host, they will be prompted to enter their information about the location in which they are hoping to have visitors at.
